                Hello my name is Isamel Salvador and this is my final project for my Web Development II class at
                Columbia College Chicago. The topic that I chose, which did take some time to figure out, but nonetheless I did
                figure out that I was going to talk about plans after college. I interview my three roommates, the
                reason I chose them is that they are all Juniors, yes, I was put in a dorm with three upperclassmen, but
                back to the topic at hand the reason I chose them is that they are all near the graduation point from
                the college here. I also did include myself for a fourth person to talk about because I also wanted to
                share my own plans after college even though that is still three years away, I felt like I should
                include myself a little more during this project and it also gives me chance to talk more about myself.
                My roommates are Christopher, Chris, and Nathan, Christophers major is …, Chris's major is …,
                Nathans major is …, and my own major is programming, I am still fresh to it, but I am trying my best to
                get the hang of it.
