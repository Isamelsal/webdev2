                Hello my name is Isamel Salvador and this is my final project for my Web Development II class at
                Columbia College Chicago. The topic that I chose, which did take some time to figure out, but
                nonetheless I did figure out that I was going to talk about plans after college. I interview my three
                roommates, the reason I chose them is that they are all Juniors, yes, I was put in a dorm with three
                upperclassmen, but back to the topic at hand the reason I chose them is that they are all near the
                graduation point from the college here. I also did include myself for a fourth person to talk about
                because I also wanted to share my own plans after college even though that is still three years away, I
                felt like I should include myself a little more during this project and it also gives me chance to talk
                more about myself. My roommates are Christopher, Chris, and Nathan, Christophers major is Contemporary,
                Urban, and Popular Music (BMus), Chris's major is Arts Management for Creative industries, Nathans major
                is Photography BA and a minor in video, and my own major is programming, I am still fresh to it, but I
                am trying my best to get the hang of it.

                    My major is programming, and I am new to it, but I am trying my hardest to understand it and get
                    better at it, I am slowly getting the hang of it, but I still have far to go. As for the part about
                    me, it isn't going to be very long compared to the others since I am just a freshman, and my goals
                    can change but for now this is what I want for my life after college. My goals after college are to
                    be able to find a good job, yes, I understand that this may take a while, but in general a good job
                    is my goal. The reason for this is I do want a family and I want to be able to support that family,
                    and in this day and age I feel like that is becoming more and more difficult. Having a good job is
                    part of what I want, but in general anything that requires technology is everywhere in this age and
                    for me being able to create something from scratch is very compelling and challenging, I have to
                    make something that is unique to myself and will impress others. I do like to be creative, but I
                    also like the challenge, if it's not challenging then to me it's not worth wild when it comes to
                    your field of work, yes it being easy makes it easy for you, but you’re not learning anything new,
                    with programming you have to keep improving and making better code so that it doesn’t get
                    compromised, and as we evolve our technology evolves, so we have to keep finding new ways to improve
                    coding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What my plans are to achieve these goals I’m still figuring out at the moment. The one thing that I
                    do know is that I will try to learn as much as I can about programming and try to learn other
                    programming languages, so I stand out more than others in my career path. I’m also going to try to
                    gain as much knowledge as I can for the future and try to learn things that are from the past, by
                    that I mean try to learn older coding languages that could be needed for some projects. I’ll also
                    learn to work with others and try to manage work in a group because in a company I won’t be working
                    alone I’ll be working with a team who has individuals that bring their own creativity to the table,
                    learning to compromise and put creative work to together will be crucial in my future so one it
                    looks better that I know how to work with a team and two I won’t be a difficult person to work with
                    and others will know that I am reliable and hardworking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What made me want to go into the field of programming is something that I don’t truly know.
                    Something has always kept my interest in the field of computers, but one thing I know is that I want
                    to become this I'm not just trying to go into a field that pays a lot of money I’m doing this
                    because it's something that I enjoy doing even if it’s challenging at times, I would rather do
                    something that I love doing and it be challenging instead of something that is easy but I don’t
                    enjoy putting time into. Another thing is that I want to be able to put what I want out in the world
                    and with programming I can do just that, with programming I will be able to do things in my own way
                    and I’ll be able to do this with others or I can do it on my own if I am able to, but I would rather
                    be able to work with a team instead of alone cause you can only do so much on your own.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I can’t really say much on if I’m proud of my progress so far, but I would like to be doing better.
                    I know that I still need to get the hang of this, but I still would like to be doing better than
                    what I am now, I wish that I was able to learn a little more during my first year, I wish that I did
                    put myself out there this year but I wasn’t able to because it is my first year at Columbia, so I
                    can’t really but that hard on myself. I will try to improve myself and try to be more active when it
                    comes to programming and try to be more social with people who want to go into this field of work.

                <h3>Chris Bonino</h3>

                    <img id="item2" src="Chris.JPG" alt="Chris">
                </figure>
                <p>
                    As stated earlier, Chris is an Arts Management Major for Creative Industries, and this is how he
                    answered the questions. My first question was what are your goals after you graduate college? He
                    said “my goals are to be a writer for shows and movies. I’d like to consistently better myself as a
                    man and especially with my faith. Hopefully my stories that I write impact the world and I’m about
                    to spread a message throughout the nation/world.” When Chris answered this question, I don’t know, I
                    could see this world in the future, but not just from Chris from others who aspire to be like him or
                    already are these types of dream. Making the world better for others is a hard thing since the world
                    is so and one person can only do so much, but with Chris I believe that he will be able to help in
                    the battle for a better world with the help of others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I then asked what are his plans to achieve these goals? He states “The writing I am going to apply
                    in seminars and other groups to perfect my craft on writing. Get a manager as well and take time to
                    dedicate to writing. Working on myself I plan to set goals like we’re talking about and act
                    according to how I run on my moral code.” With what Chris says I can see that he is very dedicated
                    to working on his goals and in my opinion, I can see him achieving them, in the reality I can’t wait
                    to see what he accomplishes in the future and see how he impacts the world with his moral code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My next question was what made you want to become this? The way he answered, it’s the sad truth of
                    the world, He said “I saw the world in a negative way because a lot of bad things happen, and I hope
                    to bring some positivity. From a young age I wanted to become president because I thought the way I
                    see the world is a lighter and brighter one.” The sad truth is the world really isn’t an amazing
                    place, a lot of bad things happen almost every day, whether it’s reported or not, something bad
                    happens and there isn’t any change. After reading what he said its good that we have people who want
                    to make a change and will try to make that change happen, some say they will and that was just an
                    empty promise, but I believe that Chris will be able to make a change happen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The very last question I asked was if he is proud of the progress so far? He says “I’m proud of the
                    person I am becoming, as for the career stuff like writing... eh not really. I’ve been writing ideas
                    down but never fully worked on them the way I want to.” With this I can see the struggle he is
                    having with not being able to work on things fully the way he wants to, I’ve had my own struggles on
                    making things the way I want them, but I know Chris is a hard-working person, I see him overcoming
                    this struggle and impacting the world one step at a time the way he wants to, while also being a
                    person with a strong moral compass, this will allow him to make friends with good people he knows he
                    can trust, trust is a very hard thing to find in the world. In the end I can see a future where
                    Chris achieves his goals and makes the world better for everyone.

                <p>
                    Now I am going to get into my other roommate Christopher, he is a Contemporary, Urban, and Popular
                    Music (BMus) Major. This was his first answer to the first question, He said “My goal is to
                    either play for a well-known musician or to become an artist myself and go on tour. I would also
                    like to try and get jobs within music business to have a steady income.” One to start off I have
                    heard Chris play in the apartment either actually playing or practicing he sounds amazing, I do know
                    that he has played in front of an audience before I unfortunately haven’t been able to attend
                    performances since I have been busy when he does do them, and from what I heard from my other
                    roommates people loved him. I do see Chris becoming a musician since he has already started to kind
                    of become one with the performances he does, and like I said from what I heard the people he has
                    played in front of like him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The way he answered the next question is something that more people should try and do, this what he
                    said, “I will achieve this by making as many friends as possible and connections that I can whenever
                    I’m at. I also need to be able to have a good practice routine and make sure I as a guitarist
                    continue to improve towards a professional level.” In the first half of what he said I can totally
                    agree on that more people should do, even if it takes time more people should try to make as many
                    friends as possible and connections, so you have reliable people and other help if you need it and
                    in the end it’s good to have others that are trustworthy and certain connections could get you
                    something could’ve taken a lot more time to get. With the last half of his response, it is a good
                    idea to always to improve even if you think that you’ve mastered something, you have to think to
                    yourself what can I do better and what can I do to make it different from anyone else.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is always interesting to learn what made a person want to become what they are or inspiring to
                    be. Chis responded to this with, “I decided to peruse music because it is something that I am very
                    passionate about and I always enjoy being around it.” I say this to myself all the time why do
                    something that you hate and despise as job for the rest of your life instead of something you love
                    doing, I don’t understand when someone gives up on the things they love, I understand that it can do
                    with the situation you’re in, but wouldn’t you want to do something you love to get out of the
                    certain situation. In my view perusing something you love is worth even if you have a few
                    difficulties along the way, in the end that makes it better because you can look back on it and tell
                    yourself I did this I made it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is also interesting to see if people are proud of their work so far and to see if they have any
                    criticism, they can tell themselves. Christoher said, “So far, I am proud of my progress. This year
                    at Columbia I have been challenged at the highest level and it’s been making me a better musician.”
                    I don’t really have much to say on this part of his interview other than that challenge is a good
                    thing sometimes it allows you to overcome the obstacles and improve yourself.

                <h3>Nathan Bieneman</h3>
                <figure>
                    <img id="item4" src="Nathan.JPG" alt="Nate">
                </figure>
                <p>
                    Nathans interview was the longest out of the three and I got to learn more about him, as I said he
                    is a Photography BA Major and has a minor in Video. I’ll just get right into it for his first
                    response he said, “My goals for after graduating college are to develop my career as a photographer
                    and documentary filmmaker. To create things, to make images, to do things that are meaningful to
                    myself and to others. To have as many unique and enriching experiences as I can, to learn as much as
                    I can about people, and about the world.” The only thing that I can say about this is that Nates
                    response was very thoughtful and meaningful, he even told me that with these questions it made him
                    think about his future and goals, I believe that Nate will be able to achieve these goals, and to
                    show off some of his work the four images of us were taken by him in our apartment, the only
                    lighting we had was just from the lights in the dorm, he is a very good photographer and I can’t
                    wait to see more of what he makes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With his second response I felt that I really got to know Nate a little more since he is a junior
                    and I’m only a freshman it was good to know what he has done here at Columbia. He responded with,
                    “While I am school, my plan is to work in the field of commercial photograph, shooting weddings,
                    pursuing positions in studio photography, product photography, etc. In order to build an expertise
                    in the technique of photography and pay the bills. I would also like to pursue a job in
                    photojournalism, in order to do this plan, I plan to volunteer at a nonprofit organization like
                    block club Chicago in order to build a larger portfolio. I’ve already started working on this
                    portfolio, and by the time I graduate I plan to have a photojournalism portfolio. I’m also
                    experimenting with making documentaries and films and I hope to continue to do this after college.
                    At this moment, my plan is not as specific as it needs to be, but I would like to make an
                    independent films/documentary and build a reputation and portfolio for myself. Ultimately, my
                    ambition would be to pitch documentaries to production companies and get larger budgets to make a
                    bigger film. It is hard for me to envision all of these aspects of the plan, as I am very focused on
                    completing my first film which is about to be entering postproduction.” This was a lot to unpack
                    when I read this but I see that Nate has a very solid plan on how he will make his goals a reality I
                    wish him the best with his documentary, I know that he is working hard on it and I believe it’ll be
                    amazing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I read about what made him want to become a photographer, I was little surprised if I’m being
                    honest, I didn’t expect him to say what he said. He said “Two years ago, I discovered a passion for
                    street photography, which became a desire to make a living using a camera. Seven months ago, I began
                    work on a photo essay about a Chicago artist which has over the course of seven months turned into a
                    documentary film. Since I began recording videos, I’ve found a similar passion for the process of
                    documentary that is very closely linked to my love of photography.  I’ve found great meaning and
                    significance in these pursuits, a feeling I haven’t experienced anywhere else. I believe the best
                    thing I can do with my time is something that brings genuine meaning to my experience of life.” With
                    this response it got me thinking, it is never too late to figure out what you want to do with your
                    life, even if you're in college something can still inspire you to do something else or to
                    incorporate that something else into your own work as creative person.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As I stated before this is a very good question to ask, it allows the person to evaluate themselves
                    and lets them see if they are doing their best and if they are, can they do better. Nate said, “I
                    don’t believe I am proud just yet of my accomplishments, I’ve become so obsessed with completing
                    this film that I will only be able to say whether or not I am proud when it is done. I believe that
                    as long as I complete it and see it through to the end, I will be proud of myself. If I get to the
                    end and still want to make films and photographs, then I will have gained a world of valuable
                    experience, and I will be one step closer to reaching my goal. I hesitate to prematurely claim that
                    I am proud. It remains to be seen, but I am optimistic.” I don’t really have much to say about this,
                    I feel like Nate could be proud of his accomplishments, but that’s not for me to decide its up to
                    him, but what I can say is that I hope he can be cause I can see that he is working his hardest.

                <h3>Mini Reflection</h3>
                <p>
                    This project even though it seems that I didn’t work hard on it I really enjoyed doing it. It showed
                    me how others thought about their future, how they thought about achieving their goals, with what
                    made them want to become what they wanted to become it kind of gives you what the person is like and
                    if they are genuinely good of heart and trustworthy, and with the last question like I said it
                    allows them to reflect on themselves and their, it allows them to criticize themselves, and give
                    themselves praise for the work they have done. I hope that others are being true to themselves and
                    true to what they want to do, it's something that gives them passion but also something they love
                    doing, people should lie to themselves, I know money is important, but doing something that you
                    enjoy should also be on their mind.
