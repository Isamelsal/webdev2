                The history of computers can be traced back to the 19th century when mathematician Charles Babbage conceptualized the first mechanical computer, the Analytical Engine. However, it wasn't until the mid-20th century that computers became widely available for commercial and personal use. The invention of the microprocessor in the 1970s paved the way for smaller and more affordable computers, leading to the personal computer revolution of the 1980s.
